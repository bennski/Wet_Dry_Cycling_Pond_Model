# Wet_Dry_Cycling_Pond_Model
Comprehensive sources and sinks numerical pond model to compute biomolecule concentrations under seasonal wet-dry cycles. Biomolecule sources are: 1) meteorites, 2) interplanetary dust, and 3) in situ production from atmospheric rainout of HCN and H2CO. Biomolecule sinks are: 1) seepage, 2) hydrolysis, and 3) UV photodissociation. Annual wet-dry cycles are computed based on precipitation, evaporation, and seepage and are based on locations on Earth today. For more details, see Pearce et al. (2017), PNAS (10.1073/pnas.1710339114) and Pearce et al. (2021), Nature Astronomy.
