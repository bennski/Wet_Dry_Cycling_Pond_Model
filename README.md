# Wet_Dry_Cycling_Pond_Model
Comprehensive sources and sinks numerical pond model to compute biomolecule concentrations under seasonal wet-dry cycles. Biomolecule sources are: 1) meteorites, 2) interplanetary dust, 3) aqueous production from atmospheric rainout of HCN and H2CO precursors, and 4) organic hazes. Biomolecule sinks are: 1) seepage, 2) hydrolysis, and 3) UV photodissociation. Rate data is experimental, based on the lunar cratering record, from non-equilibrium atmospheric models in the case of HCN and H2CO influxes, and modeled using analyses of haze production on Titan. Annual wet-dry cycles are computed based on precipitation, evaporation, and seepage with precipiration rate data corresponding to locations on Earth today. For further details, see Pearce et al.
